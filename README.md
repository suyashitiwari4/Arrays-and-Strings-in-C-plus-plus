# Aim: To study and implement C++ Arrays and Strings

# Apparatus Required:
Visual Studio

# Theory:

# Arrarys:

An array in C or C++ is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations and elements can be accessed randomly using indices of an array. They are used to store similar types of elements as in the data type must be the same for all elements. They can be used to store the collection of primitive data types such as int, float, double, char, etc of any particular type. To add to it, an array in C or C++ can store derived data types such as the structures, pointers, etc. There are two types of arrays:

One Dimensional Array

Multi Dimensional Array

# One Dimensional Array:

A one dimensional array is a collection of same data.


# Multi-Dimensional Array:

A multi-dimensional array is also known as array of arrays. Generally, we use a two-dimensional array. It is also known as the matrix. We use two indices to traverse the rows and columns of the 2D array
Strings:

C++ string class internally uses character array to store character but all memory management, allocation, and null termination are handled by string class itself that is why it is easy to use.

The string data_type in C++ provides various functionality of string manipulation. They are:

.)strcpy(): It is used to copy characters from one string to another string.
.)strcat(): It is used to add the two given strings.
.)strlen(): It is used to find the length of the given string.
.)strcmp(): It is used to compare the two given string.

# Implementation:

The following cases demonstrate the usage of arrays and strings in C++

Basic array decleration and printing

Array element Search

Min and Max Values in Arrays

Reverse Array

# Conclusion:

We have learnt and implemented arrays and strings
